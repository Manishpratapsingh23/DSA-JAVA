Fence Voltage
Problem Description
In the year 2500, Raju is building a fence to safeguard his crops from animal intrusion. The fence consists of electrified wires that deliver a shock upon contact. This is done to secure the crops.

Assume the fence in a 2D grid where these straight wires may intersect. Each intersection generates a voltage that is transmitted throughout the entire fence. The voltage generated at each intersection depends on the number of wires crossing at that point multiplied by the absolute minimum number of cells these wires touch from the intersection point to both sides (if the wire extends in both directions through the point).

Consider the below figure.

There are three wires in the fence. All three are intersecting at a point (2, 2) hence some voltage will be developed at the point which is (number of wires intersecting) * (minimum of number of cells all the wires are touching from the centre).

Let us calculate the minimum of number of cells all the wires are touching from centre.

For the wire (2, 0, 2, 4), it is touching 2 cells on one side of the point of intersection and 2 cells on other side.

For the wire (0, 2, 4, 2), it is touching 2 cells on one side of the point of intersection and 2 cells on other side.

For the wire (0, 0, 2, 2), it is touching 2 cells on one side of the point of intersection.

Hence absolute minimum of number of cells all wires are touching from centre min (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) =2

The voltage generated at the point (2, 2) will be 3 (wires)* 2 (absolute minimum # of cells) = 6 units which will be passed throughout the circuit.

The voltage generated at a specific point on the fence will be evenly distributed throughout the entire structure i.e., if more than one intersection is present, the total voltage will be sum of all voltages at intersections. Given the locations of wires on a 2D plane, a list of animal names with their respective voltage resisting thresholds, and the name of an animal that accidentally touched the fence, determine whether that animal can die by touching the fence. Also, find the probability, up to two decimal places, of animals dying by coming in contact with the fence. See Example section for better understanding.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 50

0 <= x, y <= 100

1 <= Number of Animals <= 50

Input
First line consists of an integer N, denoting the number of wires.

Next N lines will be having 4 space separated integers denoting the coordinates of starting and ending points of the wire segments in the fence placed in 2D plane.

The next line contains a string consisting of key-value pairs, separated by spaces, where each key and value in the pair is separated by a semicolon. This denotes animals and their respective voltage resisting thresholds

Last line consists of a string indicating the animal that accidentally touched the fence.

Output
On the first line, print "Yes" if the animal died, else print "No"

On the second line print the probability, up to two decimal places, of Raju securing his crops if all the animals intruded into his farm

Explanation

The given fence is represented in the 2D plane below.

The voltage will be generated at 4 points viz., (2, 4), (4, 4), (3, 5), (6, 6)

Voltage generated at (2, 4) => 2 * min (1, 1, 2, 1) = 2

Voltage generated at (4, 4) => 4 * min (1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2) = 4

Voltage generated at (3, 5) => 2 * min (2, 1) = 2

Voltage generated at (6, 6) => 2 * min (1, 1, 1, 3) = 2

Therefore, the total voltage passing through the fence is 2+4+2+2=10.

Since the animal that touched the fence is a dog, and it can only survive up to a voltage of 10 (exclusive), but the fence carries a voltage of 10, it will certainly lose its life. Therefore, print "Yes".

Since 3 out of 6 animals have voltage resisting capacity lesser than voltage of his fence, the probability of animals dying by accidentally touching the fence is 3/6 i.e., 0.5. Hence the probability of Raju securing his crops if all animals intruded into his fence is 0.5.

Explanation

The given fence is represented in the 2D plane below.

com.tcs.cv.automata.ei.middleware.DocxToHtmlConverter@4d4960c8:image3.png

The voltage will be generated at 3 points viz., (3, 3), (5, 5), (7, 7)

Voltage generated at (3, 3) => 3 * min (1, 2, 2, 2, 5) = 3

Voltage generated at (5, 5) => 2 * min (3, 3, 4, 4) = 6

Voltage generated at (7, 7) => 2 * min (1, 2, 6, 5) = 2

Therefore, the total voltage passing through the fence is 3+6+2 = 11.

Since the animal that touched the fence is a cow, and it can only survive up to a voltage of 14, but the fence carries a voltage of 11, it will not lose its life. Therefore, print "No".

Since 2 out of 6 animals have voltage resisting capacity lesser than voltage of his fence, the probability of animals dying by accidentally touching the fence is 2/6 i.e., 0.33. Hence the probability of Raju securing his crops if all animals intruded into his fence is 0.33.
