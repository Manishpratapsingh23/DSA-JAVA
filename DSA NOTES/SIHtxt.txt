ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Experience at the Smart India Hackathon 2024 ðŸŒŸ
I recently had the privilege of participating in the Smart India Hackathon at GLA University, where my team and I worked on a project titled: "AI Tool/Mobile App for Indian Sign Language Generator from Audio-Visual Content in English/Hindi to ISL Content and Vice-Versa."
Our aim was to develop a solution that bridges communication barriers and improves accessibility for the deaf and mute community. This experience was both challenging and rewarding, providing valuable insights into the technical complexities of application development and demonstrating the significant role that technology can play in promoting inclusivity.
I am deeply grateful to my college and mentors for their invaluable support and guidance throughout this journey. I look forward to applying these insights to future projects that drive meaningful impact.
